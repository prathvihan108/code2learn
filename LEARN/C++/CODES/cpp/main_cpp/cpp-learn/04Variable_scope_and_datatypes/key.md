//Macros

A macro is a piece of code in a program that is replaced by the value of the macro. Macro is defined by #define directive. Whenever a macro name is encountered by the compiler, it replaces the name with the definition of the macro. Macro definitions need not be terminated by a semi-colon(;).
Below are the programs to illustrate the use of macros in C/C++:

Program 1: 


// C program to illustrate macros
#include <stdio.h>
 
// Macro definition
#define LIMIT 5
 
// Driver Code
int main()
{
    // Print the value of macro defined
    printf("The value of LIMIT"
           " is %d",
           LIMIT);
 
    return 0;
}
Output
The value of LIMIT is 5
Program 2: 



// C program to illustrate macros
#include <stdio.h>
 
// Macro definition
#define AREA(l, b) (l * b)
 
// Driver Code
int main()
{
    // Given lengths l1 and l2
    int l1 = 10, l2 = 5, area;
 
    // Find the area using macros
    area = AREA(l1, l2);
 
    // Print the area
    printf("Area of rectangle"
           " is: %d",
           area);
 
    return 0;
}
Output
Area of rectangle is: 50
Explanation: 
From the above program, we can see that whenever the compiler finds AREA(l, b) in the program it replaces it with the macros definition i.e., (l*b). The values passed to the macro template AREA(l, b) will also be replaced by the statement (l*b). Therefore, AREA(10, 5) will be equal to 10*5. 
 Types Of Macros 

Object-like Macros: An object-like macro is a simple identifier that will be replaced by a code fragment. It is called object-like because it looks like an object in code that uses it. It is popularly used to replace a symbolic name with numerical/variable represented as constant.
Below is the illustration of a simple macro:

// C program to illustrate macros
#include <stdio.h>
 
// Macro definition
#define DATE 31
 
// Driver Code
int main()
{
    // Print the message
    printf("Lockdown will be extended"
           " upto %d-MAY-2020",
           DATE);
 
    return 0;
}
Output
Lockdown will be extended upto 31-MAY-2020
2. Chain Macros: Macros inside macros are termed as chain macros. In chain macros first of all parent macro is expanded then the child macro is expanded. 
Below is the illustration of a Chain Macro:


// C program to illustrate macros
#include <stdio.h>
  
// Macro definition
#define INSTAGRAM FOLLOWERS
#define FOLLOWERS 138
  
// Driver Code
int main()
{
    // Print the message
    printf("Geeks for Geeks have %dK"
           " followers on Instagram",
           INSTAGRAM);
  
    return 0;
}
Output
Geeks for Geeks have 138K followers on Instagram
Explanation: 
INSTAGRAM is expanded first to produce FOLLOWERS. Then the expanded macro is expanded to produce the outcome as 138K. This is called the chaining of macros.
 
   3. Multi-line Macros: An object-like macro could have a multi-line. So to create a multi-line macro you have to use backslash-newline. 
Below is the illustration of multiline macros:


// C program to illustrate macros
#include <stdio.h>
 
// Multi-line Macro definition
#define ELE 1, \
            2, \
            3
 
// Driver Code
int main()
{
 
    // Array arr[] with elements
    // defined in macros
    int arr[] = { ELE };
 
    // Print elements
    printf("Elements of Array are:\n");
 
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        printf("%d  ", arr[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}
Output
Elements of Array are:
1  2  3  
   4. Function-like Macro: These macros are the same as a function call. It replaces the entire code instead of a function name. Pair of parentheses immediately after the macro name is necessary. If we put a space between the macro name and the parentheses in the macro definition, then the macro will not work. 
A function-like macro is only lengthened if and only if its name appears with a pair of parentheses after it. If we don’t do this, the function pointer will get the address of the real function and lead to a syntax error.
Below is the illustration of function-like macros:


// C program to illustrate macros
#include <stdio.h>
 
// Function-like Macro definition
#define min(a, b) (((a) < (b)) ? (a) : (b))
 
// Driver Code
int main()
{
 
    // Given two number a and b
    int a = 18;
    int b = 76;
 
    printf("Minimum value between"
           " %d and %d is %d\n",
           a, b, min(a, b));
 
    return 0;
}
Output

Minimum value between 18 and 76 is 18
Here is one example that will give more understanding of Macros:

Problem: We need to find the area of a circle by defining AREA(r) Macros. 


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
#define  PI  3.1416
#define  AREA(r)  (PI*(r)*(r))
 
int main() {
     
      float r = 7;    // radius of circle
       
    cout<<"Area of Circle with radius " << r <<": "<< AREA(r);
   
    return 0;
}
 
// This code is contributed by balbiriitbombay3602
Output
Area of Circle with radius 7: 153.938
Conclusion
Macros are small pieces of code that can be executed with a single command. They can be used to automate tasks, simplify complex processes, and improve productivity. However, there are also some disadvantages to using macros. Here are some of the advantages and disadvantages of macros:
